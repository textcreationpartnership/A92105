            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have been by your Royall commands viewing the ſtate of our garriſon at Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and though the Governour Serjeant Major <hi>Aſhton</hi> be a ſouldier of unqueſtionable experience and performance, and the men under his command valiant enough and well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, yet ſurely according to the models of the Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh fortifications it could not long hold out, ſhould a ſtrict and hard ſiege be laid to it by the Parliaments forces, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes being neither ſtrong, their graffes or ditches being dry, and their vamures unpalliſado'd, to that a reſolute enemy without much difficulty or long aſſault might mount them: and it is with works of this manner, as it is with evill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes in men, which when they are once got in can hardly be driven out againe: And in my weake judgement, ſhould theſe wars continue, nothing could be ſo much conſiderable as the ſtrengthening of Cities and good Townes, eſpecially thoſe that have benefit of waters and Rivers, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of advantages and paſſages, the erecting Sconces and Forts: For by this art have the States of the united Provinces not onely defended that little plat of ground they firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, but alſo have tired out, and diſcouraged all thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Forces, which have yearely by the King of Spaines procurement been ſent for the reducing of thoſe parts to his obedience, theſe wars only by the ſtrength of the Hollanders Townes, having more exhauſted his Indian treaſure, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wars againſt France or the Turke. nay againſt as the world, having expended, as it is credibly computed ſince Duke <hi>d'Alva's</hi> time in the Netherlandiſh wars, a hundred millions of duckats, a ſtupendious ſumme, and more then the whole Lands of the Hollanders Continent are worth to be ſould at twenty yeares purchaſe.</p>

In which time the Hollander gained that from him which he could never ſince revan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, namely the ſtrong Townes of <hi>Sluce, Iſendicke,</hi> and other places of importance in Flanders, by which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and theſe Lords may perceive the neceſſary benefits of ſtrong Townes, ſhould the wars (which with all my ſoule I pray may have a ſpeedy end) continue in theſe your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties dominions, the want of theſe excellent fortifications having beene the principall cauſe of the ſo much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted loſſe of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to my deare father of ſacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and the reaſon why the <hi>Spanyard</hi> and <hi>Bavarian</hi> have ſo long held that rich and fruitfull Province, hath chiefly derived it ſelfe from their erection of new fortreſſes there, and ſtrengthening the old; a policy which the now raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperour, terrified with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> conqueſts, at my being his priſoner, with all diligence began to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, leaving no place that might impeach the enemy in his paſſage to his hereditary <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Countries unfortified,</p>
            <p>But perhaps your Majeſtie and theſe Lords will alledge, that you believe the warres here will not be of ſo long continuance as ſhall require ſuch fortifications; I pray to heaven they may not, in the meane time it can be no ill policie to raiſe ſuch ſtrengths, the ſuoduing which, ſhall more impaire the Parliaments forces, and conſume them more money then they can poſſibly any wayes elſe be forced to expend, nay, render your Majeſty divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantages over them.
